This project's objective delves into the domain of neuroscience where we have to parse, filter, preprocess EEG data and train a brain computer interface (BCI) program using the data. A BCI is a 
direct communication link between the brain's electrical activity and an external device, most commonly a computer or robotic limb. See [BCI Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface).
